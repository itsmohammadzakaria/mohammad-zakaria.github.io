     <p class = "testimony">I believe in Allah as He is, with His names and qualities, and I have accepted all His orders.
I believe in Allah,(I bear witness that there is no Lord except Allah), in His Angels, His Scriptures, His Messengers(Muhammad S.A.W is His prophet! I testify that Ebraheem, Musa, Isa, Zakariyya , Yahya and all other Prophets Allah has sent down were true.) , the Last Day, and that everything good and bad in the world is predestined by the Almighty Allah, and I believe in Resurrection after Death.
I also testify that Paradise is true( I ask Allah for the highest rank of paradise, al-Firdaws), Hellfire is true( I seek refuge in Allah from it).
